# Project Name: Fillit

The goal of this project is to arrange the Tetriminos among themselves to make the smallest possible square, but in some cases, this square may have holes when some given pieces wonâ€™t fit perfectly with others.

## Usage:

'''
./fillit <FILENAME>
'''

## Update:

Fixed by norm and some minor optimization.
